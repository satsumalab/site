	abstract = {A fully automatic two-dimensional Unet model is proposed to segment aorta and coronary arteries in computed tomography images. Two models are trained to segment two regions of interest, (1) the aorta and the coronary arteries or (2) the coronary arteries alone. Our method achieves 91.20\% and 88.80\% dice similarity coefficient accuracy on regions of interest 1 and 2 respectively. Compared with a semi-automatic segmentation method, our model performs better when segmenting the coronary arteries alone. The performance of the proposed method is comparable to existing published two-dimensional or three-dimensional deep learning models. Furthermore, the algorithmic and graphical processing unit memory efficiencies are maintained such that the model can be deployed within hospital computer networks where graphical processing units are typically not available.Competing Interest StatementJoseph Jacob has received consultancy fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche, GSK and NHSX unrelated to the submitted workFunding StatementJoseph Jacob was supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship (209553/Z/17/Z) and Joseph Jacob and Wing Keung Cheung were supported by the NIHR BRC at University College London.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The research study is approved by UCL ethics committeeAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
