abstract: 'Bronchiectasis is a radiological diagnosis made using computed tomographic (CT) imaging. Although visual CT assessment is necessary for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, visual assessment of disease severity and progression is challenging. Computer tools offer the potential to improve the characterization of lung damage in patients with bronchiectasis. Newer imaging techniques such as MRI with hyperpolarized gas inhalation have the potential to identify early forms of disease and are without the constraints of requiring ionizing radiation exposure.'
