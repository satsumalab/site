Ryoko is a Japanese Board-Certified Radiology Specialist and currently a Research Fellow in the Satsuma Lab at the Hawkes Institute, University College London (UCL). Her subspecialty is thoracic radiology, with a particular focus on diffuse interstitial lung diseases. She has spent most of her career in the Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, at Saga University. From September 2008 to March 2010, she trained under Prof. Junya Fukuoka, gaining experience in the pathological diagnosis of diffuse interstitial lung disease.

From 2014 to 2015, Ryoko worked as a researcher at the Royal Brompton Hospital under Prof. David Hansell, and she has continued collaborating with Dr. Joseph Jacob, who was then a fellow under Prof. Hansell. Her primary academic interest has been the radiologic-pathologic correlation, which has been a consistent theme throughout her career and is now applied in current Hip-CT research. She has co-authored over 65 papers and has received both national and international awards for her work at scientific congresses. Ryoko also contributed as a member of the committee for the Diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis in Adults: An Official ATS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice Guideline.
