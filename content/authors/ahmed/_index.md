Ahmed is a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Computer Science</a> at UCL. His current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for the prognosis and diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Diseases from medical images and other clinical information, as part of the 
<a href="https://www.osicild.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)</a> efforts to enable rabid advances in the fight against the various respiratory diseases.

Prior to UCL, Ahmed worked as a senior machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.intixel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intixel</a> (Cairo-based startup for AI in radiology) and spent a six-month research internship at <a href="http://inceptioniai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inception Institute of AI</a> in Abu Dhabi. He got his BSc and MSc from Mansoura University and Nile University in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Further, he has first-author research papers published in MICCAI and ISBI conferences and served as a reviewer for the [International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11263), [IEEE Access](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/),  [FAIR MICCAI Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fair-workshop-2021/organization?authuser=0), and [NILES'19](https://www.nilesconf.org/) conference.
