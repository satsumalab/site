Yaozhi Lu is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), working on medical imaging analysis and long term mortality prediction from lung CT scans. He also works for the Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED) project at UCL on various data and computing resource management related issues.

Yaozhi completed his PhD study at Rolls-Royce Vibration University Technology Centre (UTC), Imperial College London. During his PhD, he had investigated the Alternate Passage Divergence (APD) phenomenon in jet engines using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and machine learning techniques. He had initiated and organised various research outreach events with Imperial College London, Rolls-Royce Vibration UTC, Rolls-Royce plc, and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). Yaozhi became a Chartered Engineer (CEng) in 2021.

He worked briefly with the EU research partners on the <a href="https://www.arias-project.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Advanced Research Into Aeromechanical Solutions (ARIAS) project </a> before joining CMIC to pursue his interests in deep learning and computer vision.
