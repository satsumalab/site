Gabrielle is a research fellow at University College London in the Center for Medical Image Computing working with Dr Joseph Jacob on detecting patients with co-existent lung fibrosis and determining imaging characteristics that predict fibrosis progression on longitudinal CT scans. Before joining UCL, she was a PhD student and postdoc in the department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge investigating functional breast cancer MRI.
